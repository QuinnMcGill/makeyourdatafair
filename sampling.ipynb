    "# Fairness Evaluation with Uniform Sampling\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the application of various sampling strategies to balance a dataset for fairness evaluation, particularly focusing on uniform sampling. The goal is to evaluate how different sampling techniques can impact fairness metrics, specifically for gender-based fairness in income prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in this notebook:\n",
    "1. Load the dataset and preprocess it (encoding categorical variables, filtering by hours worked).\n",
    "2. Apply uniform sampling to balance the dataset.\n",
    "3. Evaluate fairness metrics based on gender."

    "### Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying uniform sampling and evaluating the fairness metrics, we compared the results with those obtained from oversampling. The key fairness metrics we are focusing on are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Parity Difference**: Measures the difference in favorable outcomes across protected groups. A negative value indicates that the protected group (in this case, females) is less likely to receive a favorable outcome compared to the unprotected group (males).\n",
    "2. **Disparate Impact**: Measures the ratio of favorable outcomes between the protected and unprotected groups. A value less than 1 indicates that the protected group is disadvantaged.\n",
    "3. **Demographic Parity**: Similar to statistical parity, this metric ensures that each group has the same proportion of favorable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the results for each sampling strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Oversampling:\n",
    "- **Statistical Parity Difference**: -0.3092\n",
    "- **Disparate Impact**: 0.4692\n",
    "- **Demographic Parity**: -0.3092\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uniform Sampling:\n",
    "- **Statistical Parity Difference**: -0.1963\n",
    "- **Disparate Impact**: 0.3580\n",
    "- **Demographic Parity**: -0.1963\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Parity Difference**:\n",
    "   - **Oversampling**: The oversampling method has a larger negative value for statistical parity (-0.3092) compared to uniform sampling (-0.1963). This suggests that oversampling increases the disparity between the protected group (females) and the unprotected group (males), as the oversampling method over-represents the unprotected group, leading to an exacerbated disparity in favorable outcomes.\n",
    "   - **Uniform Sampling**: This method reduces the disparity in statistical parity, resulting in a less negative value (-0.1963). It ensures that both protected and unprotected groups are represented more evenly in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Disparate Impact**:\n",
    "   - **Oversampling**: The disparate impact value for oversampling (0.4692) is quite low, indicating that the protected group (females) is disadvantaged, but to a lesser extent than with uniform sampling.\n",
    "   - **Uniform Sampling**: The disparate impact for uniform sampling is 0.3580, which is slightly worse than oversampling but still indicates a noticeable disadvantage for females compared to males. This metric shows that while uniform sampling improves fairness, it still leaves some disparity between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Demographic Parity**:\n",
    "   - **Oversampling**: Similar to statistical parity, the oversampling strategy results in a more significant negative value (-0.3092) for demographic parity, showing a stronger disparity in favorable outcomes.\n",
    "   - **Uniform Sampling**: The demographic parity for uniform sampling is also less negative (-0.1963), which shows that uniform sampling reduces the disparity in the proportion of favorable outcomes between the protected and unprotected groups compared to oversampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- **Oversampling** exacerbates the disparity between the protected and unprotected groups, leading to a stronger imbalance in favorable outcomes. While it increases the representation of the under-represented group, it does so at the cost of creating a more significant fairness issue.\n",
    "- **Uniform Sampling**, on the other hand, reduces the disparity in fairness metrics, particularly in terms of statistical parity and demographic parity. Although it still shows some disadvantage for females, it represents a more balanced approach compared to oversampling, particularly when considering fairness in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, uniform sampling appears to be a better method for achieving fairness, especially in terms of reducing the disparities between protected and unprotected groups."
